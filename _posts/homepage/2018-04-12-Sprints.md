For the first time in its' history, PyData Amsterdam will host Open Source Contribution Sprints. These will take place
on Monday the 15th.

Our sprints are a day of intensive learning and development on an open source project of your choice.
It’s a time to come together, to share what you’ve learned during the conference with the people you met, 
and apply it to an open source project.

We will bring together eager developers and maintainers of some of the libraries we all use and love to learn and 
do our share in helping out with open source development. 
 

# Who can participate?
You! All experience levels are welcome; sprints are a great opportunity to get connected with, 
and start contributing to your favorite Python project. Participation in the sprints is free! We do ask you to
sign up so we can make sure we have enough facilities in place to host everyone.
