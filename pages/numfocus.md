## NumFocus
The mission of NumFOCUS is to promote sustainable high-level programming languages, open code development, 
and reproducible scientific research. We accomplish this mission through our educational programs and events as 
well as through fiscal sponsorship of open source scientific computing projects. We aim to increase collaboration and 
communication within the data science and scientific computing community.

*NumFOCUS is a 501(c)3 public charity in the United States.*
