The PyData Amsterdam conference is an annual event which brings together users and developers of open-source software.

In addition to all the great talks  and workshops, there is no place like PyData Amsterdam to meet other like-minded people
and get to talk to the developers of the libraries we all use and love.

PyData Amsterdam 2020 will take place from June 12 - 15.
