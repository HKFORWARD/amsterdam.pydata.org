Code breakfasts are PyData Festival's workshop track. We'll meet in the morning and together with an expert in the field
we'll do a hands-on session to build something cool and gain some new knowledge on the way. 

Code breakfasts run from 09:00 to 10:30, and at the end of each session, the speaker will be available for additional questions.
Also, this is a great moment to join up with others who attended and try to see if you can go a bit beyond the breakfasts content
itself and tackle some of the harder challenges the speaker discussed.
