The PyData Amsterdam conference is an annual event which brings together users and developers
of open source software.

In addition to all the great talks 
and workshops there is no place like PyData Amsterdam to meet other like minded people
and get to talk to the developers of the libraries we all use and love.

We are currently busy preparing for the next edition.
