[NumFOCUS](https://www.numfocus.org) is the non-profit organization that fiscally sponsors [33 Open Source Projects](https://numfocus.org/sponsored-projects) 
and organizes community-driven educational programs for users and developers of open source scientific tools. 
Donations from PyData conferences account for a significant portion of our annual operating budget and enable us to 
continue giving back to the open source community. 

While there are no costs this year for a venue or catering, there are still costs associated with bringing the event online.
We also need to continue paying fixed costs to keep NumFOCUS healthy so we can keep PyData alive, as well as continue 
supporting the open source community.

We hope you understand the difficult situation we are currently in and can support us during this time so that we can
keep supporting you in the future.
